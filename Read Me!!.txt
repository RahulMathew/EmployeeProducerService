1. To Run Confluence Kafka in Terminal (Linux Windows Subsystem Terminal)
confluent local services start

2. Run the DB Script (For Table and SPs)

3. Create a topic called "testtopic" in Confluence Kafka Control Admin Page

Note: If different topic name is needed goto appsettings.json of EmployeeProducerService
and change the line   
"EmployeeServiceTopicName": "testtopic"

If topic generation needs to be configured modify
"TopicGenerationTimeIntervalInMinutes" :  1

Default Port being used for Confluence Kakfa is 9092. In order to change it modify
"ConfluenceKafkaServiceBusUrl": "localhost:9092"

Do the same change in EmployeeConsumerService
"ConfluenceKafkaServiceBusUrl": "localhost:9092",
"EmployeeServiceTopicName": "testtopic",
"EmployeeServiceTopicGroupId": "testtopic-group",
"TopicGenerationTimeIntervalInMinutes": 1,

4. Change the Sql Server connectionString if needed in EmployeeConsumerService appsettings
and EmployeeServiceApi
"SqlConnectionString": "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Workforce;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"

5. First Run EmployeeProductionService. This will generate employee data and post it
to Confluence Kafka topic

Secondly Run EmployeeConsumerService. This will subscribe to the topic and send it to
business layer and broadcast SignalR messages

Thirddly Run EmployeeConsumerSignalRRecieverClient to listen to SignalR messages broadcasted by EmployeeConsumerService 

To stop receiving SignalR messages modify appsettings.json in EmployeeConsumerSignalRRecieverClient
"ListenToSignalRBroadCasting": true

Fourthly Run EmployeeServiceApi to get the list of employees paginated

Api will return totalPages and totalRecords 

https://localhost:7135/api/employee/getEmployees/1/10

In the example given below, api result tells us that there are 7 pages and 63 totalRecords

Some pagination Plugins need totalRecords inorder to generate the Pagination UI

{"result":{"totalPages":7,"pageData":[{"employeeId":1,"employeeName":"Employee 1","hourlyRate":76,"hoursWorked":76},{"employeeId":2,"employeeName":"Employee 2","hourlyRate":35,"hoursWorked":35},{"employeeId":3,"employeeName":"Employee 3","hourlyRate":62,"hoursWorked":62},{"employeeId":4,"employeeName":"Employee 4","hourlyRate":58,"hoursWorked":58},{"employeeId":5,"employeeName":"Employee 5","hourlyRate":29,"hoursWorked":29},{"employeeId":6,"employeeName":"Employee 6","hourlyRate":47,"hoursWorked":47},{"employeeId":7,"employeeName":"Employee 7","hourlyRate":33,"hoursWorked":33},{"employeeId":8,"employeeName":"Employee 8","hourlyRate":80,"hoursWorked":80},{"employeeId":9,"employeeName":"Employee 9","hourlyRate":57,"hoursWorked":57},{"employeeId":10,"employeeName":"Employee 10","hourlyRate":73,"hoursWorked":73}],"totalRecords":63},"statusCode":200}

Note : There is still some issue in SignalR which is under investigation.

Everything is working as expected SignalR although code seems to be correct
